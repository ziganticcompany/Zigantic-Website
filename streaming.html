        In 1997, after being charged a $40 late fee for a Blockbuster movie, a
        man envisioned a platform containing thousands of movies that could be
        accessed anywhere, with no late fees or DVD players involved. That man
        was Reed Hastings, soon-to-be CEO of Netflix.

        Twenty-one years later, we’ve seen the rise of move streaming sites such
        as Hulu, HBO, and Popcornflix along with music streaming platforms
        including Spotify, SoundCloud, and Pandora. Now, this streaming craze is
        shifting towards the video game industry. The reason behind the ongoing
        movement towards video game streaming is the same spark that any
        entrepreneur embodies: improvement. Any pioneering idea stems from the
        desire to bring innovation out of stagnancy, to solve everyday problems
        currently inhibiting the time, potential, and satisfaction of today’s
        generation. As several mobile and PC game developers announce titles
        heading to Google’s cloud system Stadia and Microsoft’s Project xCloud
        among others, it is imperative to understand its potential impacts—both
        beneficial and detrimental—on the gaming industry.

        <h3><strong>Accessibility vs. Quality</strong></h3>
      </center>
      <p>
        Pete Hines, senior vice president of marketing and communications at
        video game publisher Bethesda, explained, “Some folks would like to be
        into gaming but don’t have $400 or $500 to spend on a console and then
        another $60 to spend on a game.” Video game streaming completely
        undermines this problem, allowing gamers to download and play games on
        any device in any location with WiFi. This ease in accessibility saves
        people time and cost, and could possibly encourage the rise of
        conventionally unappreciated games, but at a price; although bulky
        consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation are expensive, their GUIs and
        controller usage mechanisms are much more smooth and developed than that
        of an iPhone or Surface Pro. However, this sacrifice may not be entirely
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matt Fleming, an engineer in Microsoft’s Project xCloud team, explained
        that he and his colleagues are working to perfect two different forms of
        video game streaming: one that is integrated with console controllers,
        and one that harnesses touchscreen and keyboard input. As of now, his
        team is focusing on attaching controllers to mobile devices to allow
        both the ease of console controlling and the transportation of
        traditional smartphones. Fleming predicts that this form of game
        streaming will become the most widely used.

        <h3><strong>Latency</strong></h3>
      </center>
      <p>
        Fleming went on to explain that video game streaming is fundamentally
        built upon virtual machines. The premise of game streaming is as
        follows: a user starts a game on their phone. An available Microsoft
        server then hosts that game, replicating a traditional gaming console.
        The game is continuously streamed from the server to the user’s phone,
        allowing for portable gameplay. However, this strategy for game
        streaming introduces a large problem: latency, the delay before data
        transfers. Consistent latency in game streaming can introduce lags and
        buffering, which are not only irritating but can affect major aspects of
        the game such as health, timed task performance, and deaths. Only if
        this problem is solved will game streaming rise in popularity.

        <h3><strong>New Gaming Audiences</strong></h3>
      </center>
      <p>
        Finally, Hines described that cloud gaming can “unlock potential gamer
        populations in developing countries around the world, where
        infrastructure issues may be holding the field back.” Underdeveloped
        countries with formerly little access to popular games will now be able
        to take part in this global gaming community, giving rise to
        cross-continental relationships in a whole new sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to also consider that the complexity behind video game
        streaming can cause mass confusion. As Laine Nooney, assistant professor
        and historian of video games at New York University, asserted, “There is
        quickly becoming too many choices, too many products, and we&#8217;ve
        still seen zero consumer experience. …This might be an example of
        executives thinking they are solving a problem that no one asked them to
        solve.” Will video game streaming be the next Netflix—or the next
        Theranos? Only time will tell.
