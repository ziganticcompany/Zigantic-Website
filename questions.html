<center><h1>Six Questions To Guide Your Game Testing Feedback </h1></center>
<center><h3>Arav Manchanda</h3></center>

<p>
    What feedback would benefit you most - what do you want to understand or know specifically?
</p>

<p>
    In other words, how can you craft your questions to help guide testers into providing solutions or information that can truly help improve your game ? For instance, if you aren’t sure about how difficult a feature is, the best question to ask is 
</p> 
<h3>How hard/easy did you find this part of the level? </h3>
    <p>
      Questions like these can help guide testers' responses, or in some cases, can help uncover the solution to the problem you are facing. It is important to set clear goals for your game and understand exactly how to guide game testers to give you the feedback you need. 
      <br><br>
    Ask the testers questions that would help you understand the overall dynamic of your game for first time players – 
</p>


<h3>What did you do first? After that? Did you know or understand what you had to do at the beginning? Throughout? </h3>
<p>
    Questions like these help you understand the flow of the game, because as the game developer, you know your game best, and therefore don't truly understand exactly how the game would look to a first-time player. Use questions like the ones above to get a better understanding of your game from the eyes of beginners. 
    <br><br>Don’t directly ask questions involving overall quality, difficulty, etc. Be as specific as possible. 
</p>

<h3>Was the boss in the third level too easy? Too hard? Well designed? Was the UI of the menu and loading screens easy to navigate through? </h3>
<p>
    It is psychologically proven that without the right questions it is impossible to give completely unbiased, honest feedback<span>&#8212;</span>and this is especially true with game testing. For this reason, you must use questions that give the tester specific things to think about. If you ask for something “overall,” they’ll usually only keep a couple things in mind about their experience, but later experience a problem they had forgotten about that frustrates them. Instead, when they think about specific things, such as “the boss in level 3,” they think back to their specific experiences and can give you more constructive feedback. 
</p>

<p>Like the last question, come up with more ways to implement specificity: </p>

<h3>Think back to a specific experience you had from levels 1-3 that frustrated you, or that you think helped engage you and made you more interested in the game. What was it like? What could be improved?</h3>
<p>
    Questions like these are much more likely to give you a response that really helps you, rather than compliments or one-sided criticism. If you give the tester a task that encourages them to look back at and think about specific gameplay moments, they can thoroughly remember an experience that was significant to their time playing the game and can better express their emotions during those moments, which always serves as great feedback and gives you an opportunity to look for emotional patterns in feedback. 

    <br><br>Go step by step so that the testers can give their immediate feedback to each part: 
</p>
<h3>Start level one, and after fully completing it, answer the question: Did the tutorial give you enough information to finish level 1 without confusion? </h3>

<p>Going step by step with your testers naturally gets them to be more specific and give more thorough answers. Coupling this with specific questions will give you very constructive feedback. Another benefit of them following step by step instructions means that you can ask slightly broader questions and still get detailed responses. 

    <br><br>Finally, ask your testers questions geared towards what stood out to them and what made them like your game. </p>

    <h3>If you were to recommend this game to a friend, what would be the reason you give them for why you liked it? </h3>

    <p>A question like this helps not only close out the survey well but also tells you what makes your game unique. This question makes tester feel comfortable and at ease—they feel as if they are simply talking to a friend about a game and what they like about it. This is how you get the informal response that you need to understand what people like about your game, so you know how to emphasize your selling point. </p>

<p>Using these 6 question guidelines, you can create the perfect game testing survey and get more out of your testing. </p>
